# Containerd vs Docker

- Container Runtime Interface (CRI) allows any vender to work as a container runtime for Kubernetes as long as they adhere to Open Container Inititive (OCI) standards
    - OCI consists of:
        - Runtime spec: Specifications on how container runtime should be developed
        - Image spec: Specifications on how an image should be built
- Docker wasn't built to support the CRI standards
    - Kubernetes introduced dockershim to support Docker outside of CRI
- dockershim was removed in Kubernetes 1.24 since support was added for containerd and Docker works with containerd
- containerd is an industry standard container runtime
